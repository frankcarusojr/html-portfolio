<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've spent my career in sales and marketing roles, most recently as Associate Director of Ecosystem Develeopment at TRON DAO, a global leader in the blockchain space.
  My passion is product so I've learned to code and am building a new way to manage mass applicants utilizing AI for SMB's. 
  It also will help applicants themselves as the promise of this software is no ghosting and positive feedback for the applicants. 
  AI can be utilized to help polish their resume based on the type of job they are searching for and they will always recieve an answer in the hiring process. </p>

<p>I live in Saint Petersburg Florida with my family. I love to fish and go to the beach in my spare time. I'm also a movie nerd.</p>

<p>I built out this website to share more about myself with potential clients, partners and employers. It is a place where my most recent coding projects can be found 
  and sampled as well. I do freelance coding work while working on my AI-Powered Recruitment Platform.
